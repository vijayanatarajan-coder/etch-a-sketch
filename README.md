Project's Title - ETCH-A-SKETCH

Project Description - Created a webpage with a 16x16 grid of square divs. Created the divs using JavaScript.
Used Flexbox to make the divs appear as a grid. “Hover” effect is set so that the grid divs change color when your mouse passes over them, leaving a (pixelated) trail through your grid like a pen would. Button is added on the top of the screen that will send the user a popup asking for the number of squares per side for the new grid. Once entered, the existing grid should be removed, and a new grid should be generated in the same total space as before (e.g., 960px wide) so that you’ve got a new sketch pad.
The limit is set for the user input to a maximum of 100. A larger number of squares results in more computer resources being used, potentially causing delays, freezing, or crashing that we want to prevent. Button tags in HTML and and javascript function is used when the button is clicked.

My application does to show the game in a console.
